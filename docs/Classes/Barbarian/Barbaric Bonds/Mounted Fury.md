Type: "Ex"
Description: "The barbarian gains the service of a mount. It gains a companion as described on the companion page treating your levels in barbarian -3 as your spell prowess bonus to determine the progression of this companion (and stacks with spell prowess bonus gained from other sources). The animal companion gained this way must select the quadruped or serpentine base form. It gains the animal type as its companion type. In addition the animal companion begins with the Altered Size (Large Size) and Mount companion talents. The companion gains these types and talents even if the barbarian does not meet the prerequisites. While companions can take many forms a barbarianâ€™s animal companion should usually have a form similar to that of a beast (wolf, tiger, boar, horse, etc..) though the GM may allow for other creatures. If a barbarian releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This is treated similarly to the ranger's animal companion class feature when determining what classes and sources this companion may receive talents from."
